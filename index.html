      <h1>What Programmers do</h1>
      <p>In general, the programmer's job is to convert problem solutions into 
        instructions for the computer. That is, the programmer prepares the 
        instructions of a computer program and runs those instructions on the 
        computer, tests the program to see if it is working properly, and makes 
        corrections to the program. The programmer also writes a report on the 
        program. These activities are all done for the purpose of helping a user 
        fill a need, such as paying employees, billing customers, or admitting 
        students to college.
